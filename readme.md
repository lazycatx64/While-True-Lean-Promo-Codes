
# What

These are Promo Codes I gathered from many place, should be all of it hopefully.

Also some of my basic python exercises for automated Promo code input, if you know python, you can run this script.

# How

1. First, install **pyautogui** and **pynput** package using this line:
    > pip install pyautogui pynput
1. Start your game and set it windowed mode.
1. Load a save or start new game.
1. Open the **Menu window** by pressing **Esc**.
    (The Promo Code input box from main menu does not take Enter key press, so the script will work better here.)
1. Execute **process.py**, script will **start in 5 seconds**.
1. Move the cursor to Promo Code input box **before the script starts**,
    the script will try to keep the cursor in place and click the input box before it trys to type the code.
1. Wait for the script to finish, or press **TAB** key to stop the script.
